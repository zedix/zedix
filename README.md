About me:

I‘m a product engineer, focusing on fundamentals like `Web Standards`, `Accessibility`, `Modern CSS`, `HTML-first architecture` and `Web Components`.

I like to create applications using **"HTML-first"** framework/tools that only augment/enhance the web platform (not replace it or change it), with markup-first, small bundles and less UI-rendering JavaScript code.
